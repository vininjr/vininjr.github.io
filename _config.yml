bio:  "I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the Federal University of Ceara, 
      I love studying and learning new skills, exchanging work experiences with people
      around me and sharing my knowledge with those who want it. 
      since 2014 and I have Development Experience since 2018 as Trainee in NPDS. 
      I am the co-creator of the EDeVE blog, a free portal with articles, tutorials,
      etc. on software and IT development. I am a contributor to the blog SempreUPdate,
      focused on free software and IT. The goal of this project is to help people who want to 
      to learn about Software Development and start their careers in IT and to help people who
      are already working with Software Development to improve their technical knowledge to obtain 
      better job opportunities. I like working with both front-end and back-end development.
      I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies."
