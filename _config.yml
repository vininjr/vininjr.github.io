bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover.
      I graduating in Computer Science and Development. I love to study and learn new skills,
      exchange work and study experience with people around me and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web Development 
since 2014 and with Experience Development since 2018 as Trainee in NPDS too.
      I'm the co-creator of EDeVE, a free portal with articles, tutorials, etc, about Software Development and IT. The purpose of this project is to help people who want
      to learn about Software Development and start their careers in IT area and to help people that already work with Software Development to improve their
      technical knowledge to get better job opportunities.
      I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development. I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies."
